            <p class="bio-desc">
                I am a current student of the Engineering Immersion Bootcamp at Thinkful,
                studying about various web development subjects such as Interactive Web Apps, 
                Asynchronous web apps, Client-side programming with React, Server-side programmming with Node and Postgres, and Authentication with JWT.

                <br/>
                I love and hate coding. Coding did not cross my mind until I saw that it could solve most problems and make most ideas come to life.
                I was amazed by thefact that a programmer can develop projects which could change people's lives and their own career. 
                After learning how to code for some time now, I came to understand that coding is difficult, 
                but also comprehensible over time as you learn more about coding and its nature. Sometimes I would get overwhelmingly excited about solving 
                a coding obstacle that prevented me from finishing the project that I was working on. Learning that I can code, 
                I set my goals to have a skillset for the current job market, preparing myself to work alongside other developers and pursue a career as a programmer.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                When I'm not coding, I'm often found on my computer watching Japanese Animated TV series (Anime), updating my music playlist, 
                playing video games, working out, or studying topics which intrigue me such as stocks trading or investing. 
                Even though I do not have background in techonology, I am still a lifelong learner. As a lifelong learner, 
                I look forward to coding, learning more about coding, and working on projects with coding.
